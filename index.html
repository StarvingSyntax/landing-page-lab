                        The motivation for the establishment of Academic Journals was to enable African scholars have access to high quality peer reviewed articles, and also to enable researchers across the globe have access to articles published by African researchers without any form of restriction. This led to the publication of the first journal â€“ the African Journal of Biotechnology in 2002.  Professor Nyerhovwo J. Tonukari, co-Founder, Academic Journals captured this motivation in three of his articles published between 2004 and 2005. In these articles, Professor Tonukari argues for the need of scientific journals to adopt the open access model. He stated that open access model of publication is the most effective way to distribute research output, bridge the information gap between developing and advanced countries and help improve research productivity worldwide.</p>
